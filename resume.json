Through this project, I learned how to structure the front-end and back-end of a web app, using Rust and TypeScript + React.

I researched security for the authentication and found a middle-ground between complexity and security that I was happy with for this hobby project.",

This has greatly improved my Linux and networking skills, taught me a multitude of server technologies, and given me an insight into security considerations. I am always looking for new things learn and run on this server\n\nI also used a Raspberry Pi to create a remote-control socket switch using relays. It incorporated a Node JS server controlled via my Home Assistant server. This project taught me a lot about hardware and circuits.",
