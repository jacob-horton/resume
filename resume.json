Through this project, I learned a lot about creating a web apps in React and Rust - state management, RESTful APIs, security/firewalls, Cloudflare Tunnels, and much more. It was my first go using Rust as an API - I loved it, especially the compile time safety of SQL query checking. I did a dive into learning how authentication is handled using JWTs, access tokens and refresh tokens. While I know my implementation wasn't the most secure (e.g. using localstorage instead of HTTP only cookies), I learned a lot and it was good enough for my use case.",

It incorporated a Node JS server controlled via my Home Assistant server. This project taught me a lot about hardware and circuits.",
